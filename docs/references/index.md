# API Reference

API reference documents are organized by resource:

* [Pedals Resource](pg-resource-pedals.md)
* [Songs Resource](pg-resource-songs.md)

### Note

The API reference topics refer to The Pedal Garage's base URL as `{base_url}`. The server's base address is typically `http://localhost:3000` on test and development installations. If `http://localhost:3000` is not your server's base address, then replace `{base_url}` with the address of the server that hosts your The Pedal Garage API.
