# Quickstart Guide

Ready to dive in? This guide will walk you through the steps of making your first requests with The Pedal Garage API!

## Before You Begin

If you have not done so already, make sure to have your development environment set up prior to following this guide. Refer to the [Before You Start](pg-before-you-start.md) guide.

Having a basic understanding of how curl commands work and the Postman application functionality will be helpful.

Expect this guide to take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Retrieve a Specific Pedal by ID

**Endpoint**

To retrieve details about a specific pedal, use the `GET /pedals/{id}` endpoint.

**Request Example**

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/pedals/1
```

**Return Example**

```shell
[
  {
    "id": 1, 
    "make": "Electro-Harmonix",
    "model": "Big Muff",
    "trim": "Ram's Head",
    "family": "fuzz",
    "songIDs": [3]
  }
]
```

## Add a Pedal

**Endpoint**

To add a pedal to the database, use the `POST /pedals` endpoint.

**Request Example**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/pedals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": null,
    "make": "MXR", 
    "model": "M117R", 
    "trim": "NA", 
    "family": "flanger", 
    "songIDs": [4]
  }'
```

*Note*: To ensure the `id` field is placed at the beginning of the object and matches existing database entries, include
it in your request. Otherwise the `id` field will automatically be populated at the end of the object. Setting the id
to null will trigger the system to generate a new, chronologically sequential identifier for the object.

**Return Example**

```shell
[
  {
    "id": 9,
    "make": "MXR",
    "model": "M117R",
    "trim": "NA",
    "family": "flanger",
    "songIDs": [4]
  }
]
```

## Search for Songs by Pedal

**Endpoint**

To search for songs by pedal, use the `GET /songs?pedalIDs_like={pedalID}` endpoint.

**Request Example**

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/songs?pedalIDs_like=1
```

**Return Example**

```shell
[
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "That Lady, Pts. 1 & 2",
    "artist": "The Isley Brothers",
    "year": "1964",
    "label": "United Artists",
    "pedalIDs": [1,2]
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Causes of Errors**

Some common situations that cause errors include:

* **Incorrect Command**: Double-check your commands for typos or errors.
* **Wrong Directory**: Verify that you are in the correct directory in your command-line tool.
* **Missing Software**: Ensure that all required software components are installed correctly, as outlined in the [Before You Start](pg-before-you-start.md) guide.
* **Outdated Software**: Refer to the [Before You Start](pg-before-you-start.md) guide for instructions on updating your software to the latest version.

**Common Response Codes**

| Status Code      | Category       | Description | Troubleshooting Tips |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
