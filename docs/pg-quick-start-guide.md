# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps of making your first requests with The Pedal Garage API.

## Before You Begin

If you have not done so already, make sure to have your development environment set up prior to following this guide. Refer to the [Before You Start](pg-before-you-start.md) guide.

Having a basic understanding of how curl commands work and the Postman application functionality will be helpful.

Expect this guide to take about 20 minutes to complete.

## Make Your First API Request



## Error Handling

If you don't see the list of pedals, or receive an error in any step of the procedure, investigate and correct the error before continuing.
Some common situations that cause errors include:

1. You mistyped a command.
2. You aren't in the correct directory.
3. A required software component didn't install correctly.
4. A required software component isn't up to date.
