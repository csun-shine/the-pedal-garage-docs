## API Reference

The API reference topics refer to The Pedal Garage's base URL as {base_url}. The server's base address is typically http://localhost:3000 on test and development installations. 

If http://localhost:3000 is not your server's base address, then replace {base_url} with the address of the server that hosts your Pedal Garage API.
