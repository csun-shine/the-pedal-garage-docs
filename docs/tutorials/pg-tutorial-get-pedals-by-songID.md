# Tutorial: Get Pedals by SongID

One of the core features of this API is the ability to retrieve a list of pedals associated with a songID. This tutorial will walk you through the steps on how to get songs by pedal. You can use either curl via the command line or Postman. Expect this tutorial to take 15 minutes to complete.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have completed the "Before you start" tutorial and set up your development system prior to proceeding with this tutorial. Having a basic understanding of how curl commands work and the Postman application functionality will be helpful.

## Running JSON Server

1. There are a couple of different methods to open the Pedal Garage in a Git Bash window.

   1.1. *Method 1*: The first method is through the Git Hub desktop application. Make sure you are in the Pedal Garage repo, then click "Repository" in the navigation menu at the top. From the drop-down menu, select "Open in Git Bash". This opens the main folder. Navigate to the api folder by running the `cd api` command.

   1.2. *Method 2*: Alternatively, you can open the repo in Git Bash through the locally saved folder. Open whichever folder the Pedal Garage API is saved in. Select and right click the "api" sub-folder and select the "Open in Git Bash" option. This method automatically opens the api folder within Git Bash.

2. In the Git Bash window you have opened, run the JSON server by entering the following command.

   ```shell
   json-server --watch the-pedal-garage-db-source.json
   ```

3. If you have successfully started the JSON server, the response should look like the following:

   ```shell
     \{^_^}/ hi!

     Loading pedal-garage-db-source.json
     Done

     Resources
     http://localhost:3000/pedals
     http://localhost:3000/songs

     Home
     http://localhost:3000

## Get Pedals by SongID - curl

1. If you have not done so, run the JSON server following the steps given in the "Running JSON server" section.

2. Leave the JSON server running and open the repo again in another Git Bash window using one of the two methods explained in the "Running JSON Server" section. For this, it does not matter which directory is opened.

3. Run the following curl command. Replace `{base_url}` with the base URL or directory where your API is hosted.

   ```shell
   {base_url}/pedals?songIDs={songID}
   ```

4. For example, if we wanted to retrieve the pedals associated with songID 3:

   ```shell
   {base_url}/pedals?songIDs=3
   ```

5. The response would look like:

   ```shell
   [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "make": "Electro-Harmonix",
       "model": "Big Muff",
       "trim": "Ram's Head",
       "family": "fuzz",
       "songIDs": [3]
     },
     {
       "id": 2,
       "make": "Maestro",
       "model": "PS-1A Phase Shifter",
       "trim": "NA",
       "family": "phaser",
       "songIDs": [3]
     },
     {
       "id": 3,
       "make": "Dunlop",
       "model": "Cry Baby",
       "trim": "Classic",
       "family": "wah",
      "songIDs": [3]
     }
   ]
   ```

6. Run the curl command given in Step 3 to retrieve the songs for whichever pedal you want.

## Get Pedals by SongID - Postman

1. If you have not done so, run the JSON server following the steps given in the "Running JSON server" section.

2. Leave the JSON server running and open the Postman application.

3. Either open a new request window or use whatever previous work environments and collections you have set up.

4. Select the "GET" method in the request box drop down menu.

5. In the request box, input the following. If you do not have an environment set up with a `{base_url}`, type out the base URL directly into the request box.

   ```shell
   {{base_url}}/pedals 
   ```

6. Under the "Key" column of the "Query Params" section, input `songIDs`.

7. Under the "Value" column of the "Query Params" section, input the ID of whichever song you want to retrieve the pedals for. For example, put `3` if you want to retrieve the pedals for `songID: 3`.

8. Click "Send".

9. Response body should be populated with all pedals associated with `songID: 3` like below:

   ```shell
   [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "make": "Electro-Harmonix",
       "model": "Big Muff",
       "trim": "Ram's Head",
       "family": "fuzz",
       "songIDs": [3]
     },
     {
       "id": 2,
       "make": "Maestro",
       "model": "PS-1A Phase Shifter",
       "trim": "NA",
       "family": "phaser",
       "songIDs": [3]
     },
     {
       "id": 3,
       "make": "Dunlop",
       "model": "Cry Baby",
       "trim": "Classic",
       "family": "wah",
       "songIDs": [3]
     }
   ]
   ```

10. Adjust the value in the "Value" column and send the request to retrieve the songs for whichever pedal you want.
