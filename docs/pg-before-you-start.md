# Tutorial: Before You Start

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up the Pedal Garage development environment.
You must complete these steps before you can run any of the other tutorials for **The Pedal Garage API**.
You only have to do this one time per development system.

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

Expect this tutorial to take about 20 minutes to complete.

## Before You Begin

To complete the tuotorial, you need a development system (PC, Mac, or Linux) running a current or
long-term support (LTS version of the operating system).

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

The first step to setting up your Git environment is to create a [GitHub](https://github.com)
account. You can use an existing GitHub account if you already have one or create a new one by
going to the GitHub website linked above.

## Step 2: Download, Intall, and Configure Git on Your Computer

The Pedal Garage requires using Git on the command line and so [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
needs to be downloaded, installed, and configured on your computer.

Once Git is donwloaded to your computer, set your username in Git by following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git)
tutorial.

Once your username is set, setup your commit email address in Git by following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
tutorial.

## Step 3: Download GitHub Desktop

Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). GitHub desktop allows you to work with Git locally without using the command line.

## Step 4: Fork The Pedal Garage Repo

The following steps explain how to fork the To-Do Service repo.

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to [The Pedal Garage Repo](https://github.com/csun-shine/the-pedal-garage-docs).
3. In the upper right hand corner of the page, click **Fork**.
4. Select the owner of the forked repo under the "Owner" dropdown menu.
5. If you wish to rename the forked repo, type a name into the "Repository name" field.
Otherwise, the forked repo will be named after its upstream repo by default.
6. Click **Create fork**.

If you would like more information on forking repos as well as information on how to clone forked repos,
refer to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) tutorial.

## Step 5: Authenticating with GitHub from Git

In order to connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you will need to authenticate with GitHub.
Follow the steps in [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git#authenticating-with-github-from-git) tutorial to do so.

## Step 6: Install node.js and the json-server

Download and install the LTS version of **node.js** [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).
Make sure you select the latest LTS version from the dropdown menu to download. Select the relevant OS. Accept all default options.
Follow the steps below to test if your download was successful.

1. Open a commmand line window.
2. Run the `node -v` command.
3. If a version number is returned (e.g., v22.11.0), then node.js was sucessfully installed.

Once **node.js** has been installed, follow the steps below to install the **json-server** package.

1. Open a command line window.
2. Run the `npm install json-server` command.

Once packages are installed, test the command line.

1. Run the `json-server --help` command.
2. If you see the help display for the **json-server**, then the **json-server** was successfully installed.

More information regarding the json-server can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

## Step 7: Syncing Fork

Before beginning any work, make sure that your fork is in sync with the original repo. To do so, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to your forked repo on GitHub.
2. In the upper right hand corner of the main dashboard, click **Sync fork**.

**TIP**: If you're using a fork of the repo, create a working branch in which to do your tutorials. Create a new branch for each tutorial to prevent a mistake in one from affecting your work in another.

## Step 8: Download Postman

Download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) desktop app.
Because *The Pedal Garage** is run on your development system with an `http://localhost` hostname, the web-version of Postman can't perform the requests.

## Step 9: Test Your Development System

Test your development system by following the steps below: 

1. Open The Pedal Garage API in a Git Bash window and run the JSON server by entering the following command.

```shell
json-server --watch the-pedal-garage-db-source.json
```

If your development system is installed correctly, the response should look like the following: 

```shell
  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading pedal-garage-db-source.json
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/pedals
  http://localhost:3000/songs

  Home
  http://localhost:3000

  Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
  Watching...
```

2. Open the Pedal Garage API in another Git Bash window to make a test call to the service.

```shell
curl http://localhost:3000/pedals
```

3. If the service is running correctly, you should see a list of pedals as shown in the example below.

```shell
[
  {
    "id": 1, 
    "make": "Electro-Harmonix",
    "model": "Big Muff",
    "trim": "Ram's Head",
    "family": "fuzz",
    "songIDs": [3]
  },
  {
    "id": 2, 
    "make": "Maestro",
    "model": "PS-1A Phase Shifter",
    "trim": "",
    "family": "phaser", 
    "songIDs": [3]
  },
  {
    "id": 3, 
    "make": "Dunlop",
    "model": "Cry Baby",
    "trim": "Classic",
    "family": "wah", 
    "songIDs": [3]
  }, 
    ...
]
```

If you see the list of pedals from the service, you have successfully set up your development environment!

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the list of pedals, or receive an error in any step of the procedure, investigate and correct the error before continuing.

**Common Causes of Errors**

Some common situations that cause errors include:

* **Incorrect Command**: Double-check your commands for typos or errors.
* **Wrong Directory**: Verify that you are in the correct directory in your command-line tool.
* **Missing Software**: Ensure that all required software components are installed correctly, as outlined in the [Before You Start](pg-before-you-start.md) guide.
* **Outdated Software**: Refer to the [Before You Start](pg-before-you-start.md) guide for instructions on updating your software to the latest version.

**Common Response Codes**

| Status Code      | Category       | Description | Troubleshooting Tips |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 200 OK           | Success        | The request was successful. | Not Applicable |
